# BSDS3002
Courework (ongoing) of BSDS3002 Social computing and network analysis.

Overview of concepts covered in the assignments are as follows.

# Assignment 1
Basic network construction, visualisation and network measurements (density, diameter, centralities).

# Assignment 2
Node-level measurement: clustering coefficient, structural equivalence (Cosine and Jaccard similarity value).

# Assignment 3
Construction and inspection of larger network (around 1000 nodes and 10,000 edges). Interpretation of measurements in context. Gephi visualisation. 

# Group Project
A group project on network analysis and computational propaganda in the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. Code and materials in [this repository](https://github.com/Yvonne27Jin/BSDS3002GP_Computational_propaganda_Ukraine).
